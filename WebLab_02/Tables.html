		<td>I like University of Michigan because it is a big school with football and<br/>
		many other activities. Michigan is a well respected academic school and would challenge me <br/>
		with difficult classes for my selected major. Michigan is lower on my list just because of how<br/>
		far away it is and how cold it gets but I would still love to go to this school.</td>
