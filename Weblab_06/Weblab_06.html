<p>My name is Emma Pacelli and I'm a junior at Torrey Pines High School. I've gone to Torrey Pines since frehsman year, I've never taken computer programming so everything is very new to me.
 I play competitive soccer and beach volleyball outside of school. I have three siblings, two older sisters and a younger brother. My favorite food is pineapple, I love travelling, I love snowboarding, and love the beach. So excited to learn more about computer programming in this classs!! </p><br/>

	<h2><strong>Notes about Weblab 1</strong></h2><br/><hr/>
	<div>
	<p>In web lab 1 I learned how to create a basic HTML website using Notepad++. By using Notepad++, I was able to work on a document, save it, and open it in chrome for a visual on how it turned out.<br/>  
	In the beginning of the lesson, I watched videos on how to add a head, body, and title to my website. This created the basic frame or outline of my page.<br/>
	Once I had that frame figured out, I learned how to "acccesorize" my website to make it look the way I wanted. I learned how to make words bold, adding pictures, how to separate paragraphs, italicize, etc. It allowed me to make my website personal and professional looking.<br/>
	I think the most important thing I learned involved site navigation and implimenting ways to make it easier to get to every place on the website. It's important for the viewer to have easy access to all pages and information.
